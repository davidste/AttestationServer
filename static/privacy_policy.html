            <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>The 'Submit sample data' and 'Enable remote verification' features make HTTPS
            connections to the https://attestation.app/ server which will be logged by the web
            server.</p>
            <p>The 'Submit sample data' feature will submit a sample attestation and a survey of
            system properties accessible to every app without permissions.</p>
            <p>The 'Enable remote verification' feature will prompt to scan a QR code from an account
            on https://attestation.app/ and will use that to subscribe to submitting attestations to
            that account on https://attestation.app/ at the configured rate.</p>
            <p>Attestations contain a certificate chain provided by the hardware-based Trusted
            Execution Environment on the device including assorted verifiable system information. The
            app also collects other supplementary security information which is displayed in the app
            and service for successful verifications.</p>
            <p>A persistent hardware-backed key is generated for each Auditor-Auditee pairing either
            between two instances of the app or between the app and https://attestation.app/. The
            ability to use the persistent key to sign verifiably fresh attestations is used as part of
            performing verification of the integrity and identity of the device. The keys are wiped
            when the app is uninstalled or app data is cleared via the OS.</p>
            <p>The camera permission is used to scan QR codes from the Auditor app on another device
            or the https://attestation.app/ service. Images captured by the camera are not stored,
            exported in any way or used for anything else other than decoding QR codes.</p>
            <p>Samples submitted with 'Submit sample data' are published in an anonymized form at
            <a href="https://github.com/AndroidHardening/AttestationSamples">https://github.com/AndroidHardening/AttestationSamples</a>
            and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The app and service are both open source and can be audited.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy will be updated to explain how permissions and data are used as the
            Auditor app and https://attestation.app/ service are developed. It will always retain the
            property of requiring user consent to make network connections or otherwise export any
            data.</p>
